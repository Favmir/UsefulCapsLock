# UsefulCapsLock
An AutoHotKey Script that helps you type, you won't even need a Pointing Stick(a.k.a. red nipple) anymore

Press Windows + Caps Lock to bring out the menu.

[Caps Lock + white key] sends the allocated text.

[Caps Lock + grayed out key] carries out pre-determined functions. You can see what exactly they do by clicking on the GUI.

[Mouse Lock] checkbox disables mouse input and only enables it when you press [Caps Lock + S], so you wonâ€™t have to suffer from Touchpad palm press syndrome anymore.
