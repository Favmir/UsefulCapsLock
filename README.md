# UsefulCapsLock
![Gui](/Desc.jpg)

A horribly written AutoHotKey Script that helps you type.

I made this script to solve my problem of
1. palm grazing the touchpad constantly
2. arrow keys are in such inconvient places when you need to move your cursor through text a lot

Some people solve these problems via a Pointing Stick(a.k.a. red nipple) but I prefer my solution.

Press [Windows + Caps Lock] to bring out the menu.

[Caps Lock + white key] sends the allocated text.

[Caps Lock + grayed out key] carries out pre-determined functions. You can see what exactly they do by clicking on the GUI.

[Mouse Lock] checkbox disables mouse input and only enables it when you press [Caps Lock + S], so you wonâ€™t have to suffer from Touchpad palm press syndrome anymore.

I've left this script running while playing games, and so far had no problem at all with single-player games.
I've only tested a few multiplayer games:
Monster Hunter World - No problem (although Monster Hunter doesn't ban cheaters at all because they don't have paid lootboxes)
Overwatch - Doesn't detect this as a cheating software.
Team Fortress 2 - No problem
Lost Ark(MMORPG) - Detects any autohotkey process on launch and refuses to log you in. You have to quit the script to run the game
