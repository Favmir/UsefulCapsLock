# UsefulCapsLock
An AutoHotKey Script that helps you type, you won't even need a Pointing Stick(a.k.a. red nipple) anymore

Press [Windows + Caps Lock] to bring out the menu.

[Caps Lock + white key] sends the allocated text.

[Caps Lock + grayed out key] carries out pre-determined functions. You can see what exactly they do by clicking on the GUI.

[Mouse Lock] checkbox disables mouse input and only enables it when you press [Caps Lock + S], so you wonâ€™t have to suffer from Touchpad palm press syndrome anymore.

I've left this script running while playing games, and so far had no problem at all with single-player games.
I've only tested a few multiplayer games:
Monster Hunter World - No problem (although Monster Hunter doesn't ban cheaters at all because they don't have paid lootboxes)
Overwatch - Doesn't detect this as a cheating software.
Team Fortress 2 - No problem
Lost Ark(MMORPG) - Detects autohotkey process on launch and refuses to log you in. You have to quit the script to run the game
